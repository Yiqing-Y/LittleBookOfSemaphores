## lightswitch.go

Simplified solution from the book, using the "lightswitch" pattern.
I implemented Lightswitch as a type in sem.go, in the sem package,
then used it in this code.  Unsurprisingly, it works just like chanSem.go:

## noStarve.go

Implemented following the book.  It was interesting to see a little bit
different behavior in the simulation.  There are no timers or attempts to
introduce randomness in the program, but the program has some random variation
from run to run just because of randomness in the scheduler.  So runs have
some common patterns but some variation.  The common patterns of noStarve.go
are obviously a little different than the patterns of chanSem.go and
lightswitch.go

## wPriority.go

The final solution from the book.  This also shows patterns of output that are
a little different compared to the previous solutions.

## rwmutex.go

Finally, the Go solution without semaphores.  Go has a great read-write mutex
in the sync package of the standard library.  It is documented to have write
priority.  So somewhat pleasingly, the patterns of output look much like the
patterns produced by wPriority.go
