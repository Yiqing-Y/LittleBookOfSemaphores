# 4.4 Dining philosphers

## book.go

`Book.go` is an implemenation of solution #1.  While the problem is posed as
if the philosphers wish to eat indefinitely, I added a "bite" limit to limit
the output of the simulation.  Still, a sample run is rather long.

## leftie.go

A little difference in solution #2 is that since all philosophers can sit at
once, there is no getting up and down between each bite.  The all sit, they
all go through their cycles of thinking and eating (they are allowed to think
at the table) then they all wander off to end the simulation.

## mutex.go

Semaphore-free.  This is also a leftie solution.  A fork is described an object
with mutually exclusive access so it's intuitive to use a sync.Mutex for a
fork.
