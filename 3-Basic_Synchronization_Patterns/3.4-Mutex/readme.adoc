# 3.4 Mutex

Mutexes, we got.  Anyway, let's play along for a bit.

## book.go

Here's the literal implementation of the solution from the book.  Note the
semaphore initialized to 1 rather than 0.

## countSem.go

The literal implementation again, this time with CountSem from our package,
demonstrating initialization of CountSem to something greater than zero.

## mutex.go

Let's use the Go sync.Mutex.  With an associated count, it's a drop-in for the
semaphore.  I put the mutex and the count together in a parenthesised
declaration.  This is a common convention to point out the value that a mutex
protects.  It is merely a code formatting convention however; putting them
together creates no programmatic tie between them.

## buffered.go

This version is a little exercise in "sharing memory by communicating".
It demonstrates how a buffered channel can be used as a mutex.  The buffer,
`count` here, represents a place where a value may or may not be stored.
Go does not have strict concepts of ownership in the way Rust does, for
example, but a Go program can still follow conventions of ownership.  If you
follow the convention that getting the value from the `count` channel means
that you "own" it, then you can receive the value from the channel, increment
it, and then send it back to the channel as a way of relinquishing your
ownership of the value.  A buffer size of one means there can be only one
value.  It is a way to implement mutually exclusive access to a value.

## atomic.go

Really though, if you just want to increment a shared count?  sync/atomic is
the way to go.  No mutex or channel needed.
