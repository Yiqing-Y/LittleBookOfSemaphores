# 3.4 Mutex

Mutexes, we got.  Anyway, let's play along for a bit.

## chanSem.go

Here's the literal implementation of the solution from the book.  Note the
semaphore initialized to 1 rather than 0.

## countSem.go

The literal implementation again, this time with CountSem from our package,
demonstrating initialization of CountSem to something greater than zero.

## mutex.go

Let's use the Go sync.Mutex.  It's a drop-in for the semaphore, without
having to think about an initial count value.

## atomic.go

Really, if you just want to increment a shared count?  sync/atomic is the way
to go.  No mutex needed.
