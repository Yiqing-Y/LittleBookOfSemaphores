# 3.5 Multiplex

I can't but rant here.  Multiple threads in the critical section?  Um, we call
that a race condition.  It's not a pattern, it's a bug.  Multiple people in a
nightclub?  Don't let your drink be a shared resource.  You do not want
multple people accessing it.

## chanSem.go

For fun, let's try it!

$ go run -race chanSem.go

Bad idea.  Just don't.
