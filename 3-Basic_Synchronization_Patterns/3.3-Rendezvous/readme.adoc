# 3.3 Rendezvous Pattern

## book.go

A literal implementation of the book's solution using our library semaphore
implementation.  It's a symmetric solution in that the same function is used
for both goroutines, which is satisfying.  A little detail added to make a nice
working program out of it is the sync.WaitGroup to allow the main program to
wait for both goroutines to complete (their output) before terminating.  More
on WaitGroups later.

## buffered.go

This is `book.go` with Go channels replacing the semaphores.  Like `book.go`
this solution is also symmetric and after both goroutines are started, it's
indeterminate which will send first.  Whichever sends first cannot block
waiting for the other thread to receive because that other thread will also
attempt a send before receiving.  Buffered channels allow the sends to be
non-blocking.  Either can send first but neither can proceed to "statement 2"
until both have sent.  This accomplishes the rendezvous.

## chan.go

Finally, "rendezvous" is interpreted variously.  The Ada rendezvous is quite
elaborate with functionality for example.  Sometimes the term means "each
thread sends a message, each thread receives a message, and they each wait
for each other".  In the book solution and in `buffered.go` it is further
implimented such that either thread can signal or perform the send first.
Most primitively however, it means that each thread must be at
a particular place in it's own code at some same instant, with the first
thread to arrive waiting for the second.  This is exactly what a Go unbuffered
send and receive does, and it does it with a single channel.  If you don't mind
the asymmetry of one goroutine being the designated sender and the other being
the designated receiver then this is a simple rendezvous.

Note that the original problem description did not specify anything about how
the synchronization was to be performed, only that "a1" and "b1" must happen
before "a2" and "b2".  In other words, there must be some instant when thread A
execution is at the point between "a1" and "a2" and thread B execution is at
the point between "b1" and "b2".
