# 3.1 Signaling Pattern

First a little note, where LBS says "thread", of course in Go we read
"goroutine".

We use the example from the book to exercise our two semaphore implementations.
chanSem.go implements the example with a sem.ChanSem, countSem implements the
example with a sem.CountSem.

Then chan.go shows that a Go unbuffered channel accomplishes the signaling
pattern as a simple replacement for the semaphore.
