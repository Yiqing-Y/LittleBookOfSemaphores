== book-multi.go

The code has a little problem.  As seen in the last run, a car can begin

== chan-multi.go

This solution has a platform that holds up to m cars as well as a track that
holds up to m cars.  Each is modeled with a buffered channel of capacity m.
One car can be loading at a time, one car can be unloading at a time, the
loading and unloading can be concurrent.
